TCNN: A Transformer Convolutional Neural Network for artifact classification in whole slide images [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809423002458]

The TCNN, or Transformer Convolutional Neural Network, automates artifact detection in pathological images. It addresses artifact detection as a binary classification task, identifying unwanted patterns that may arise during slide processing. This method reduces laboratory technicians' need for manual labeling, minimizing the risk of sending erroneous data for analysis. Failure to identify and exclude artifact patches can jeopardize the accuracy of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems.

We have included the TCNN codebook in this repository for research purposes.
